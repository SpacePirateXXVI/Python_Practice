x = """ On the frieze just inside there were Athenians perhaps at least in one interpretation
involved in the Panathenaic Procession, the religious procession in honor of the goddess Athena.  Inside was this gigantic sculpture of Athena.
 All sculptures that were overseen by the great sculptor Phidias and parts are the metopes. Carved with scenes that showed the Greeks battling various enemies either directly or metaphorically. The Greeks battling the Amazons,
the Greeks against the Trojans, the Lapiths against the Centaurs, and the Gigantomachy.
The Greek gods against the titans. All of these battles signified the ascendancy of Greece and of the Athenians of their triumphs. Civilization over barbarism, rational thought over chaos.
Art historians depict this was the very meaning of this building.
This is not the first temple to Athena on this site. Just a little bit to the right
as we look at the east end there was an older temple to Athena that was destroyed when the Persians invaded. This was a devastating blow to the Athenians.  One really can't overstate the importance of the Persian War for the Athenian mindset
that created the Parthenon. Athens was invaded and beyond that
the Persians sacked the acropolis, sacked the sacred site, the temples.
Destroyed the buildings.  They burned them down.
In fact, the Athenians took a vow that they would never remove the ruins
of the old temple to Athena. So they would remember it forever.
But a generation later they did. They did, well there was a piece
that was established with the Persians and some historians think that
that allowed them to reneg on that vow and Pericles, the leader of Athens
embarked on this enormous, very expensive building campaign.
Historians believe that he was able to fund that because the Atheneans had become the leaders of what is called the Delian League. An association of Greek city states
that paid a kind of tax to help protect Greece against Persia
but Pericles dipped into that treasury
and built this building. This alliance of Greek city states,
their treasure, their tax money, their tribute
was originally located in Delos hence the Delian League,
but Pericles managed to have that treasure moved here to Athens
and actually housed in the acropolis. The sculpture of Athena herself
which was made of gold and ivory Phidias said if we need money we can melt down the enormous amount of gold that decorates this sculpture of Athena.  Since that sculpture doesn't exist any longer we know somebody did that. This was a storehouse. It was the treasury

We think about temples or churches or mosques as places where you go in to worship. That's not how Greek religion work. There usually was an altar on the outside
where sacrifices were made and the temple was the house of the god or goddess,
but with the Parthenon art historians and archeologists have not been able to locate an altar outside  One answer is it was a treasury. and so it was a symbol of both the city's wealth and power.   It's a gift to Athena. When you make a gift to your patron goddess
you want visitors to be awed by the image of the goddess that was inside
and of her home.  This isn't any goddess. This is the goddess of wisdom so the ability of man to understand our world and its rules mathematically,
and then to express them in a structure like this is absolutely appropriate.
 
 We have that here. To an unbelievable degree. What's extraordinary is that it's perfection is an illusion based on a series of subtle distortions that actually correct for the imperfections of our sight. That is the Greeks recognize that human perception was itself flawed and that they needed to adjust for it in order to give the visual impression of perfection. Their mathematics and their building skills were precise enough to be able to pull this off. Every stone was cut to fit precisely. When we look a this building
we assume it's rectilinear, it's full of right angles, and in fact there's hardly a right angle in this building.  There's another interpretation of these tiny deviations
that these deviations give the building a sense of dynamism.
The sense of the organic that otherwise it would seem static and lifeless.
The Greeks had used this idea that art historians call entasis before
in other buildings. Slight adjustments. For example, columns bulge toward the center.
This is not new but the degree to which it's used here and the subtlety in the way it's used is unprecedented.  For instance in those Doric columns you can see that there's a taper and you assume that it's a straight line but the Greeks wanted ever so slight
a sense of the organic. That the weight of the building was being expressed
in the bulge, the entasis of the column about a third of the way from the bottom.
In this case every single column bulges only 11/16th of an inch the entire length of that column. The way that the Greeks pulled this off is they would bring column drums
up to the site. They would carefully carve the base and the top
and then they would carve in between.  We see this slight deviation in the columns
but we also see it not only vertically but also horizontally in the building. You assume that the stylobate, the floor of the temple is flat but it's not.
Rain water would run off it because the edges are lower than the center.  But only very, very slightly lower. Across the long side of the temple the center rises only 4 3/8 of an inch and on the short side of the temple on the east and the west side
the center rises only by 2 3/8 inches. What happens is it cracks. Our eye would naturally see a straight line seem as if it rises up at the corners a little bit so it seems to us to be perfectly flat. The columns are all leaning in a little bit.  You would expect the columns
to be equidistant from one another but in fact the columns on the edges are slightly closer to one another than the columns in the center of each side.  Architectural historians have hypothesized that the reason for this is because the column at the edge
is in the sense an orphan. It doesn't have anything past it. Therefore, it would seem to be less substantial. If we could make that column a little bit closer to the one next to it
it might compensate and it would have an even sense of density across the building.
Placing of the columns closer together on the edges create a problem
in the levels above. One of the rules of the Doric Order is that there had to be a triglyph
right above the center of a column or in between each column.  They also wanted the triglyphs to be at the very edge so one triglyph would abut against another triglyph
at the corner of the building. If in fact you're placing your columns closer together
you can actually solve for that problem. You can avoid the stretch of the metope
in between those triglyphs that would result, but because the columns are placed so close together they had the opposite problem which is to say that the metopes
at the ends of the building would be too slender. What Phidias has done in concert
with Iktinos and Kallikrates the architects is to create sculptural metopes
that are widest in the center just like the spaces between the columns
and actually the metopes themselves gradually become thinner
as you move to the edges so that you can't really even perceive the change
without measuring. The general proportions of the building
can be expressed mathematically as X equals Y times two plus one.
Across the front we see eight columns and along the sides 17 columns.That ratio also governs the spacing between the columns and its relationship to the diameter of a column.  If we look at the plan of the structure we see the exterior colonnade on all four sides. On the east and west end it's actually a double colonnade and on the long sides, inside the columns a solid masonry wall. You can enter rooms on the east west only.
The west has a smaller room with the four Ionic columns within it
but the east room was larger and held the monumental sculpture of Athena.
It's interesting. The system that was used to create a volt that was high enough to enclose a sculpture that was almost 40 feet high was unique. There was a U shape of interior columns at two storeys. They were Doric and they surrounded the goddess.
The sculpture is now lost but the building is almost lost as well.Here we come to one of the great tragedies of western architecture.This building survived into the 17th century
and was in pretty good shape for 2000 years and it's only in the modern era
that it became a ruin. First it was as we know an ancient Greek temple for Athena
then it became a Greek orthodox church then a Roman catholic church and then a mosque. In a war between the Ottomans who were in control of Greece at this moment in history in the 17th century and the Venetians. The Venetians attacked the Parthenon,
the Ottomans used the Parthenon to hold ammunitions, gunpowder. Gunpowder exploded from the inside basically ripping the guts out of the Parthenon.  Then to add insult to injury in the 18th century, Lord Elgin received permission from the Turkish government to take sculptures that had already fallen off the temple and bring them back to England. The [lie] and share of the great sculptures by Phidias are now in London.

There's something about the Parthenon that is both an offering to Athena, the protector of Athens, but also something that's a monument to human beings, to the Athenians,
to their brilliance, and by extension I suppose in the modern era human spirit generally."""
